Welcome to bashcrawl!
=====================

This is a game to teach you the basics of using a POSIX (Linux, BSD,
UNIX) terminal, like the one where you are reading this message now.

Note: If you are using mybinder.org to play the game -- which is
likely if you read this text -- beware that your session is temporary
and will be reinitialized once you disconnect.

Your first move is very important.
Type this into the terminal, and press RETURN:

    cat scroll

You are now playing the game.
May the gods save you.
